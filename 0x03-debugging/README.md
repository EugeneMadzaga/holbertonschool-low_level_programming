0. Multiple mains
*  In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_nega   tive() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
   Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives t	he correct output when given a case of 0.

   You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, 	if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.
1. Like, comment, subscribe
*  Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. 0 > 972?
*  This program prints the largest of three integers.
   ? That’s definitely not right.

   Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3. Leap year
   This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into considera	tion.
